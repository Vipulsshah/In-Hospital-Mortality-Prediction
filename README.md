# In-Hospital-Mortality-Prediction
The predictors of in-hospital mortality for intensive care units (ICU)-admitted HF patients remain poorly characterized. We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients.
Done preprocessing, cleaning, Scaling and Train-Test split 
Used Logistic regression ML algorithm to get Test accuracy of 0.89%
